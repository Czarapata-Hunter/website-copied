Copying of a Website

The way I went about this was setting up my Website with the different sections / sub sections
From there, I filled the sections with the information & did CSS to further style the website
After doing that, I commented out a lot of the code to practice putting images in and moving the images around.
Was able to get the website looking very similar with the pictures

Leaving the commented out sections in the code so the process I took can be seen.
Do not want the TA's to think I just went straight for putting in a bunch of pictures.
Little tiny change
